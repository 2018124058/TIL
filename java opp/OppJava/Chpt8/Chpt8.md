# Chapter 8. Polymorphism and Abstract Class  
# 8.1 Polymorphism  
## Polymorphism  
- manipulating descendant class' object through ancestor class' reference variable  
- through a mechanism called: late binding or dynamic binding  
## Binding  
- Binding: process of associating a method definition with a method invocation  
### Early Binding  
- binding occurs when the code is compiled 
- compile time에 고정 
- java: only private, final, static methods에서 사용  

### Late Binding(Dynamic Binding)
- binding occurs when the method is invoked (at runtime)  
- java: 나머지 메소드들에서 사용
